Polymorphism: One entity in many forms, also behavior is different.

Polymorphism again of two types,
	- static/compile time
		- overloading concept
			- Constructors
			- Methods
			
	- dynamic/runtime
		- overriding
			- Methods
			
			
Note:

1. for static polymorphism we need only one class
2. for dynamic polymorphism we need more then one class(need inheritance)
